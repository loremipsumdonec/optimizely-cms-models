I can recommend reading [Reframing headless CMS](https://www.optimizely.com/insights/blog/reframing-headless-cms/) and [Headless CMS](https://www.optimizely.com/sv/optimization-glossary/headless-cms/) before you start with this post. What I will focus on is how we can move the template from Razor to technologies like React.
