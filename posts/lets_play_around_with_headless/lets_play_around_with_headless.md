preamble: "This post will give an introduction on how to use technologies such as React, Vue and Angular to build a front end with support for server-side rendering."

I can recommend reading [Reframing headless CMS](https://www.optimizely.com/insights/blog/reframing-headless-cms/) and [Headless CMS](https://www.optimizely.com/sv/optimization-glossary/headless-cms/) before you start with this post. What I will focus on is how we can move the template from Razor to technologies like React or Vue. 

> This is also not necessarily connected to Optimizely CMS but more to [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) on which Optimizely CMS is based.
